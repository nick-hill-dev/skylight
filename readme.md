# Skylight

Skylight, a browser-based HTML5 canvas game for laptops and PCs (keyboard required). An arcade shooter based on a ancient game idea from my college days.

The largest amount of code that I have ever publically published!

You can play the game now without any fuss by visiting https://nickhill.dyndns.org/games/skylight

Otherwise, download this repository and execute "BuildAndRun.ps1" to build your own copy and run it in the browser (assuming you have TypeScript installed).

Except for sound effects, this is all my own work. That includes the various libraries that have been included - sound, menus, state, Tiley etc. I have basically exported them from my own personal repository system and bundled them here.
